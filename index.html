                    The astronomical unit (symbol: au,[1][2][3] or AU) is a unit of length, roughly the distance from
                    Earth to the Sun and equal to about 150 million kilometres (93 million miles) or ~8 light minutes.
                    The actual distance varies as Earth orbits the Sun, from a maximum (aphelion) to a minimum
                    (perihelion) and back again once each year. The AU was originally conceived as the average of
                    Earth's aphelion and perihelion; however, since 2012 it has been defined as exactly 149597870700
                    m.[4]

                <p>
                    The astronomical unit is typically used for stellar system scale distances, such as the size of a
                    protostellar disk or the heliocentric distance of an asteroid, whereas other units are used for
                    other distances in astronomy. The astronomical unit is too small to be convenient for interstellar
                    distances, where the parsec and light-year are widely used. The parsec (parallax arcsecond) is
                    defined in terms of the astronomical unit, being the distance of an object with a parallax of 1â€³.
                    The light-year is often used in popular works, but is not an approved non-SI unit and is rarely used
                    by professional astronomers.[27]
